The Dream-to-Design Generator is a web application that allows users to describe a room, outfit, or website in natural language, and the AI generates a visual prototype. This prototype can be in the form of HTML/CSS code, Figma mockups, or AI-generated images. The application leverages advanced AI models such as DALL·E, Sora, or Stable Diffusion to create these visual designs based on user input.

The technology stack includes:

Frontend: React for building an interactive user interface where users can input their descriptions and view generated designs.
Backend: Flask to handle API requests, process user input, and interact with AI image generation services.
Firebase: Used for user authentication and data storage.
AI Integration: DALL·E, Sora, or Stable Diffusion models for generating images or design prototypes.
Key features:

Text input for user descriptions.
Style selection for different design aesthetics.
AI-powered generation of visual prototypes.
Options to download or mint generated designs as NFTs (planned).
Backend API to process requests and communicate with AI services.
User authentication and data management via Firebase.
This project currently includes a React frontend simulating AI art generation, and a Flask backend with an API endpoint to handle generation requests, returning simulated image URLs.
